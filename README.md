# Categorical_Website_Analysis

This repository contains the SQL code for the queries and data exploration done on a keyword analysis dataset. 
Some of the queries were then transferred into Excel so that they could be imported into Tableau Public. 
Note that this was neccessary since Tableau Public has limited funtionality.
